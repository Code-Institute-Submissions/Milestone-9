# Damien Dempsey

### Code Institute / User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

Tasked to create a static website combining knowledge from the first three modules in the Full Stack Web Development course with the Code Institute.

I am a huge fan of Damien Dempsey and I wanted to base my project on him. After using Damiens own official website https://damiendempsey.com i found it did not have enough information about him or his music. He wouldn't be a well known artist and so i felt his website should have more of this information, so I seen this as an oppurtunity to build a website to give people that knowledge of the great singer/songwriter that he is.
 
## UX

The goal of this website is to:

* Provide people with more of an understanding of the artist Damien is.
* Build his brand awareness here in Ireland but also abroad.

#### User Stories

1. As a fan or potential fan/user, I want to check where Damiens next tour or gigs will be held.
2. As a fan or potential fan/user I want to see if Damien has social a media presence so I can follow him across social media platforms.
3. As a fan or potential fan/user I want to be able to check Damiens website on my mobile device as I do not own a laptop or desktop.
4. As a fan or potential fan/user i want to be able to listen to his music or watch videos on the site.
5. As a fan or potential fan/user I want to see a contact form so I can contact the artist or his to team to answer any questions that I cannot find the answer too on the website.

#### Design & Color Scheme

In the design of this website i used [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) and some of my own custom HTML & CSS.

I used the shamrock emoji ☘️ on the homepage to emphasize Damien is an Irish Singer | Songwriter rather than just using the words on their own.
 
After trying out a few different color schemes I decided on roughly the same color scheme from Damiens own official website. I feel it really makes things pop when you have a dark background with different color overlays compared to the standard white background.

I used the standard grey setting within css for my buttons, footer and header spaces. I then used the off-white color of #fafafa for the font to really make it stand out from the dark background.

#### Wireframes

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

Further development of this website will include a merchandise store for all of Damiens merchandise and a fan forum that fans of Damien can interact about the singer/songwriter.

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
