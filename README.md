# Damien Dempsey

### Code Institute / User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

Tasked to create a static website combining knowledge from the first three modules in the Full Stack Web Development course with the Code Institute.

I am a huge fan of Damien Dempsey and I wanted to base my project on him. After using Damiens own official website https://damiendempsey.com i found it did not have enough information about him or his music. He wouldn't be a well known artist and so i felt his website should have more of this information, so I seen this as an oppurtunity to build a website to give people that knowledge of the great singer/songwriter that he is.
 
## UX

The goal of this website is to:

* Provide people with more of an understanding and information about the type of the artist Damien is.
* Create more traffic to this site but also through his social media platforms which can be found on every page.
* Build his brand awareness here in Ireland but also abroad.

#### User Stories

1. As a fan or potential fan/user, I want to check where Damiens next tour or gigs will be held.
2. As a fan or potential fan/user I want to see if Damien has social a media presence so I can follow him across social media platforms.
3. As a fan or potential fan/user I want to be able to check Damiens website on my mobile device as I do not own a laptop or desktop.
4. As a fan or potential fan/user i want to be able to listen to his music or watch videos on the site.
5. As a fan or potential fan/user I want to see a contact form so I can contact the artist or his to team to answer any questions that I cannot find the answer too on the website.

#### Design & Color Scheme

In the design of this website i used [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) for my gallery layout & album cards. I then used some of my own custom HTML & CSS for the rest of the site.

The typography ('Roboto', sans-serif;) i chose is from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

In the Navbar i used the DAMIEN DEMPSEY logo which forms the basis as the back to "HOME" page which is commonly found amongst industry standards.

I used the shamrock emoji ☘️ on the [Homepage](https://jmurray1989.github.io/Milestone-1/index.html) to help emphasize that Damien is an Irish Singer | Songwriter.
 
After trying out a few different color schemes I decided on roughly the same color scheme from Damiens own official website. I feel it really makes the website pop when you have a dark background with different color overlays compared to the standard white background.

I used the standard grey setting within css for my buttons, album cards, header spaces & footer. I then used the color of #fafafa Color Hex Gray98 for the font to really make it stand out from the dark background. For my main images on each section of the website i decided to use black & white images to keep within the same color scheme as the overall project.

To help me choose my colour scheme is used [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create).

#### Wireframes

To build my wireframes i used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) which is the software that the course briefly touches on. I found it quite easy to navigate and use so i did not look into other softwares.

All wireframes created for this project can be found [Here](https://github.com/Jmurray1989/Milestone-1/tree/master/wireframes).

Example below:-

## Features

* This is a summary of the features i have put in place on my project but also the features i hope to add in the future.

* All pages on the website follow the same principle with a fixed navbar, main image, a header and a footer with links to all of Damiens social media platforms.


### Navbar

The navbar is featured on all pages and is used to navigate the site.

 The navbar links are on the right side of the navbar. I have 6 links in total:-
- Home
- Tour
- Music
- Video
- Gallery
- Contact

Intuitive navigation fixed to the top of the the page that resizes for mobile devices with the hamburger icon. When pressed it expands to show the other navigable pages. On desktop i have used a hover function that will show the user which navpage they are highlighting and a class of active that will indentify to the user the current page they are on.

### Buttons

* I have buttons on the homepage that will navigate you to other pages within the website. I also have a button on the Tour page which will navigate you to Damiens own official tour link where you can purchase tickets for his upcoming gigs. [See Here](https://damo.tourlink.to/shows)

### Cards

* In the Music section of the website I have album cards which feature images of Damiens albums and a short write up about each one. I also added buttons to this section which allow you to play each album through Spotify. See example [Here](https://jmurray1989.github.io/Milestone-1/music.html)

### Video

* The Video section of the website has many videos of Damien performing well known songs live and also includes some interviews.

### Gallery

* The Gallery section has a range of images of Damien from live performances to appearing on television with special guests.

### Contact Us Form

* The contact page features a form so visitors can contact Damiens management looking for more information that may not be available to them on the site.

### Footer

* The footer is featured on all pages and contains clickable icons that will take you to each of Damiens social media platforms.

1. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/damiendempseyofficial/)
2. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/damodempsey)
3. [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/damiendempseymusic/)
4. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa055fVTZiTHEI0tOZWfetg)
5. [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0bmF1w9eyJrY4CHyjpTQOW)
6. [Itunes](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/damien-dempsey/67966386)


### Future Plans

Further development of this website will include a merchandise store for all of Damiens merchandise and a fan forum that fans of Damien can interact with each other and share stories about the singer/songwriter.

I also want to set-up the submit section on the form so that it will be fully operational to use.

Build a customer pre-loader, as videos and photos sometimes load slowly depending on network speeds.

I would also like to include a Blog that Damien himself could write to his fans informing them of whats going on in his world. Something which he is fond of doing on other social media platforms such as Facebook.

## Testing

Website has been tested across multiple browsers and on mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness of the site.

#### Desktop

- Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- IE
- Opera

#### Mobile Devices

- iPhone 8
- Galaxy S8 & S10
- iPad
- iPad Pro

[W3C Mark-up Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) where used to check the validity of the project code. 

Chrome Devtools was used throughout the duartion of my project for testing responsiveness of the website and for finding and fixing bugs.

#### Known Issues

* IE Doesn't support CSS Grid and because of this my more videos section does not display correctly

* IE also has a bug for the shamrock emojis that they are white instead of the color green.

* Opera has an alignment issue with my play buttons in the albums cards in the Discography section of the site.

I used a site known as [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/) to run my code in mac and safari software and the site appears to be broken. This is not official software so i cannot be sure the results are accurate. When tested my project through chrome and others on this site it also showed me errors which i do not have.
